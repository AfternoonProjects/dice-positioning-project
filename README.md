# CSS Layout mini-project
## Dice Positioning

Using the display or position property, create all six sides of a dice. You should only need to edit the 'index.html', and 'index.css', no need to change anything in 'setStyles.css'. 

For extra practice, try to create each side of the dice more than one way (use different properties).
